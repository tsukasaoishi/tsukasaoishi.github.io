　どんどん英語がおもしろくなっています。もっといろいろわかるようになりたいな。もっと単語を覚えなきゃだね。これはもう地道にやっていくしかないのかな。相変わらず、助動詞がまだ苦手です。関係代名詞はけっこうわかるのだけど。  

I want to sleep right now. I always want to sleep every day. Why? I don't know why. Maybe I should go to bed before midnight. So I would have been to bed before midnight today. But It's too late now. What am I writing? I don't know what mean I wrote it.
